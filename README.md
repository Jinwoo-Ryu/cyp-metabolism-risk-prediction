Predicting CYP-mediated drug metabolism risk from a pharmacist's perspective
## Problem Statement
Cytochrome P450–mediated metabolism, particularly via CYP3A4,
is one of the leading causes of drug failure during clinical development.
Compounds with high metabolic liability often show reduced exposure,
drug–drug interactions, or unexpected toxicity.

As a pharmacist, this project defines clinically meaningful risk categories
for CYP-mediated metabolism and aims to predict high-risk compounds early
using machine learning models based on molecular structure.

The ultimate goal is not model accuracy alone,
but supporting better decision-making in early drug discovery.
